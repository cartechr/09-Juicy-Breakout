I have completed everything that I was asked to complete
1)I added scoring systems that adds up the score based off of which and what types of tiles are hit by the ball.
3)The player has 3 lives
    3a)If the ball falls, the player has to left click to get the ball back.
4)I have spent a decent amount of time on the arrangement of the tiles, and I am very proud of this achievement.
5)I kept messing up on the first repository that I created (08-Breakout), so I decided to start fresh and created "08-Breakout-01."
